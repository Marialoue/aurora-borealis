### Aurora Borealis - Spacestagram

Front End Developer Intern Challenge from Shopify

## Objective

Create an app where users can see and like images from NASA.

## App Requirements

- Fetch and display data from one of NASA's APIs.
- Display descriptive data for each image.
- Users should be able to like/unlike an image

## Technical Requirements

- Search results should come from NASA’s free APIs, for which you’ll need a free API key from [NASA](https://api.nasa.gov)
- Each image result should list at least a title, date of capture (ideally in earth_date) and a button to “like” that image.
- Each image can be “liked”, and a user should be able to undo their “like”
- The HTML that ends up being served client-side should be accessible and semantic

## Optional features

- Save likes if the user leaves or reloads the page
- Animate the “like” action
- Add a loading state while we wait for NASA’s API to return data
- Create shareable links for each image
- Add a date-picker to be able to browse photos starting from a specific date

## Tech stack and tools

For this challenge I used a [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/) from [React](https://www.reactjs.org) and css.
